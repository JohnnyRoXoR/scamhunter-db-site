        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SCAMHUNTER is a community-driven initiative dedicated to exposing crypto scams and protecting traders. We collect and verify reports of fraudulent projects and individuals, maintain an open database of scam wallets, and share alerts across multiple platforms.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>We rely on user submissions and independent investigations to populate our database. Each report is reviewed for accuracy and evidence before being published. Our team collaborates with blockchain analysts and security experts to ensure the validity of entries.</p>
        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>You can help by reporting scams, contributing to our research, or supporting us financially. Every bit of help strengthens the communityâ€™s safety.</p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For inquiries, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@scamhunter.example">info@scamhunter.example</a>.</p>
